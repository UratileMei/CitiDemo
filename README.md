## 📂 Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

### 1. **Planning**
- Define problem scope (citizen-municipality communication gap).  
- Identify stakeholders (residents, municipality, volunteers).  
- Set milestones (MVP in hackathon, scalability post-event).  

### 2. **Analysis**
- Research common municipal pain points.  
- Define functional requirements (issue reporting, announcements).  
- Define non-functional requirements (scalability, offline support).  

### 3. **Design**
- **Architecture:** Client (Android) + Backend (Firebase).  
- **UI/UX:** Simple, intuitive design for residents of all ages.  
- **Data Flow:** Report → Firebase → Municipality Dashboard → Status Update → Resident.  

### 4. **Development**
- Android app built with **Java**.  
- Firebase for authentication, Firestore DB, and push notifications.  
- Modular structure for easy future upgrades.  

### 5. **Testing**
- Unit testing for issue submission & retrieval! 
- Integration testing for Firebase services.  
- Usability testing with sample residents (demo).  

### 6. **Deployment**
- APK build for hackathon demo.  
- Future: Publish on **Google Play Store**.  

### 7. **Maintenance**
- Fix bugs based on user feedback.  
- Add new features incrementally.  
- Ensure data security and compliance.
